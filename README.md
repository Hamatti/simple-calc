# Quick Calculator with CSS Grid

I got an inspiration to test out how I could build a good looking calculator with CSS Grid.

I used [Sarah Drasner's CSS Grid Generator](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.com) to generate layout and basic HTML/CSS/Javascript to build the rest.

## Running

Just open `index.html` and you're good to go.

## Tests

Uses [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) for tests. You can run the tests by opening up `tests/SpecRunner.html` and edit tests inside `tests.calculatorSpec.js` file.

No `package.json` management, running local versions of Jasmine (found in `tests/lib` folder) to keep it simple and easy to run even without Internet.
